On s4 : theqif/fish  - you're a sitter there too -
can you just upgrade the fields please -
and warehouse/granary accordingly -
at the mo, it'll MAX every 24hrs.

Also, back on s3 ... I'll run my atak script from obelisk -
could you check in now and again that raids are happening ...
and that there's nothing spurious in the logfile :
 - /tmp/travian_ataks.log
