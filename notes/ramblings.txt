Ultimate goal of Travian : become biggest possible player,
thrugh accumulation of most resources =>
'get as much res as poss thru ataks'

atak management is therefore required to get the max per raid.

the bounty of a raid is a factor of :
 - number of TTs (known)
 - warehouse/granary capacity (divined over time / regular scouting)
 - cranny capacity (divined over time / regular scouting)
 - target production levels (divined over time / delta between reports)

MAX_potential is defined as :
 - clay = warehouse-cranny; wood = warehouse-cranny; iron = warehouse-cranny;
 - wheat = granary-cranny;

so to glean the max for a given target :
 - send enuf TTs for the MAX_pot
 - send them at a raid_frequency such that the target is at MAX_pot

raid_frequency is defined as MAX_pot divided by target_prod_levels

eg : Madeddy has 
MAX_res (2300/2300/2300/2300)
crannies (2100/2100/2100/2100)
MAX_pot is therefore (200/200/200/200) = 800 = 11TTs required.
pot_lvl/hr (120/120/110/60)
atak_time_delta is therefore 100mins


So far, so good.  Need some sort of stateful mechanism to store this 'target meta info' - tie in with slurp of villages/alliance/users?


Attack management becomes lots more tricky when optimising for multiple targets - have to consider available TTs & travel time
