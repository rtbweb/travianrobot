Ultimate goal of Travian : become biggest possible player,
through accumulation of most resources, requiring us to
'get as much res as poss thru ataks'

atak management(AM) is therefore required to get the max per raid.

the bounty of a raid is a factor of :
 - number of TTs (known)
 - warehouse/granary capacity (divined over time / regular scouting)
 - cranny capacity (divined over time / regular scouting)
 - target production levels (divined over time / delta between reports)o

Target production Levels (TPL) is gleaned by sending 2 scouts,
15 mins apart, arriving after a successful raid.
Report Parser does the delta per res & multiplies by 4 for a per hour rate.

MAX_potential is defined as :
 - clay = warehouse-cranny; wood = warehouse-cranny; iron = warehouse-cranny;
 - wheat = granary-cranny;

so to glean the max for a given target :
 - send enuf TTs for the MAX_pot
 - send them at a raid_frequency such that the target is at MAX_pot

raid_frequency is defined as MAX_pot divided by target_prod_levels

eg : Madeddy has 
MAX_cap (2300/2300/2300/2300)
crannies (2100/2100/2100/2100)
MAX_pot is therefore (200/200/200/200) = 800 = 11TTs required.
pot_lvl/hr (120/120/110/60) (2 scouts, 1 after raid, another 15mins later
atak_time_delta is therefore 100mins

So far, so good.  Need some sort of stateful mechanism to store this 'target meta info' - tie in with slurp of villages/alliance/users?

Attack management becomes lots more tricky when optimising for multiple targets - have to consider available TTs & travel time.  Targets need to be arranged in to a priority list - a 'value quotient' based on MAX_pot & number of visits possible in 24hrs ..
